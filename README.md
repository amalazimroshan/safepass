## SafePass

SafePass is a project aimed at enhancing road safety by providing real-time information to drivers about the feasibility of overtaking a large vehicle, such as a truck. The system utilizes machine learning, computer vision, and vehicle dynamics to calculate and display a safety signal on the back of the truck, helping following drivers make informed decisions.

#### Features

- Object Detection: Utilizes PyTorch and OpenCV for real-time detection of vehicles in front of the large vehicle.

- Distance and Speed Calculation: Determines the distance between the large vehicle and the detected vehicles, as well as the speed of the large vehicle.

- Safety Signal: Displays a dynamic red or green signal on the back of the large vehicle based on calculated safety parameters, indicating whether it's safe to overtake.

### Why SafePass?

#### Road Safety Impact
According to World Health Organization, road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death among young people aged 5â€“29. SafePass aims to contribute to reducing accidents related to overtaking, a common cause of road incidents.

#### Overtaking Statistics
In a study conducted by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), improper overtaking maneuvers contribute significantly to road accidents. SafePass addresses this issue by providing real-time safety information.
